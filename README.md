# Rental Property Management System

A Python-based financial tracking tool designed to streamline the management of multiple rental properties. This system acts as a centralised digital ledger, automating the reconciliation of rent collection, maintenance costs, and mortgage obligations to provide clear insight into property profitability.

## 📌 Project Overview
Managing the finances of rental properties manually can lead to errors and a lack of clarity. This project solves that problem by:
* **Centralising Data:** Replacing manual notes with a structured digital log.
* **Automating Math:** Automatically calculating net cash flow (Revenue - Expenses).
* **Performance Tracking:** Comparing actual revenue against mortgage obligations to determine immediate profitability.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Transaction Logging:** Efficient input of granular financial details (Rent received, Repair costs, Maintenance fees).
* **Automated Financial Reporting:** Generates a concise summary for each property with a single command.
* **Profitability Analysis:** Calculates net cash flow and highlights performance against mortgage benchmarks.
* **Data Integrity:** Uses input validation to ensure financial records are accurate and consistent.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:** Data Structures (Dictionaries/Lists), Control Flow (Loops), and Input Validation techniques.

## 💻 How to Use
1.  Run the script in any Python environment (IDLE, VS Code, or Terminal).
2.  Follow the prompts to input property details (Name, Mortgage amount).
3.  Enter transaction data (Rent collected or Repair costs).
4.  Select the "Generate Report" option to view the financial summary and cash flow analysis.
